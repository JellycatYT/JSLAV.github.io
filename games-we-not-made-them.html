        Kumanchu defence force by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Pixelarcher10">Pixelarcher10</a>
      </div>
      <div>
        Brand new defense! Defend the bear base against the doges! Click and drag your bear and hold anywhere else to fire bullets!<br><br>
        Current boss: tree bear awakens! Attack the menacing tree bear! But be careful, tree bear has a chance to deflect bullets, once you defeat him you'll get a reward of coins! tree bear will also summon doges to fight alongside him!<br><br>
        Current event: the aku realms, unlock the aku seal and enter the aku realms! Face stronger enemies<br><br>
        So essentially I mixed kumanchu royal and nyanko defence force :/<br>
